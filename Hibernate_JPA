Hibernate and ORM
	Hibernate is a ORM framework that implements JPA specification.
	The main goal of Hibernate is to provide objects with metadata that makes persistence of the state of the application easier without writing and sql statements.
	HQL is used to query objects and it is similar to SQL.
	There are 3 steps to use and configure Hibernate.
		1. Configure Hibernate
		2. Create entities using annotations.
		3. Obtain a session from the SessionFactory and invoke persistence methods.

ORM
	Persistence refers to the characteristic of state that outlives the process that created the state.
	Persistence mostly involves working with a RDBMS.
	RDBMS is a collective set of multiple data organized by tables, records (rows) and columns.
	Records in tables can be associated by keys(primary and foreign)
	The keys also help in forming functional dependencies between records of tables.
	Data model is a structure in place that specifies how we are going to store our data.
	Object model is one class for each table in the data table. There will be one member variable of the class that corresponds to each field in the data model.
	There will be discrepancies that exist between the object model and data model.
		In a data model we use the primary key to uniquely identify the record and in object model we use the equals()
		In the data model we use foreign keys to relate two records and in the object model, we use object references to associate two objects.
		In data model we use joins to navigate the associations and in the object model, we use the getters and setters.
		There is no concept of inheritence in data model whereas the object model has inheritence.
	Along with the discrepancies between data model and object model, we also find certain challenges with JDBC.
		Error handling in JDBC
		Key managements in JDBC
		Implementation inconsistancies in JDBC
		Verbose code.
	ORM solves the above mentioned problems
		Reduces persistence code, development time and maintenance.
		Bridges gap between data model and object model.
		Removes most of the SQL from the application logic.
		Helps build a better persistence layers.
		ORM has sound key managements
		Consistent implementation throughout teams.
	ORM addresses the problems that is caused by JDBC.

Field and property access
	Hibernate can use field access or property access to fetch values from an entity.
	Field access means, Hibernate has direct access to the private field of an entity class.
	Property access means that Hibernate will use the getters and setters to get access to the field.
	We can tell Hibernate what kind of access to use.
		1. If we want to use property access, annotate the getters and setters with the required annotations. If we want to use field access, directly annotate the fields of the entity class.
		2. Use the @Access annotation and set the value on the @Access to field or property.

Drawbacks of JDBC
	With JDBC, the developer has to do additional work such as
		Open a DB connection
		Maintain a open connection
		Build a query
		Execute a query
		Getting a response to a query
		Mapping query output with custom class
		Closing the connection
	We use ORM tools to avoid the above problems.
	To avoid this hectic process, we can use the ORM tools available in the market. It works as a bridge between the application and database by simplifying the communication between them.

Benefits of ORM
	Reduces development time and cost.
	Provides portability. Hibernate supports multiple databases, so there is no need to write a database-specific code. This is achieved by Hibernate's dialect.

Useful features of Hibernate
	Code reusability.
	Transaction management
	Efficient collections/custom class mappings.
	Caching mechanism support in Hibernate

Creating Hibernate persistent class
	We are to create a Java class that will represent a DB table. The Java class must have the following requirements
		1. It needs to have a default constructor that is persistent.
		2. It should contain the id attribute. ID is used to identify the object and is mapped with the primary column of a table.
		3. All attributes should have Getter and Setter methods.
	
	Consider the following table. Its persistent class will be as follows
	 __________
	| Employee |
	|__________|
	|	id	   |
	|	name   |
	|	salary |
	|__________|

	public class Employee {
		private long id;
		private String name;
		private long salary;
		Employee() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

	POJOs can have reference to other object as well

	 __________		 _______________
	| Employee |	|	Department	|
	|__________|	|_______________|
	|	id	   |	|		id		|
	|	name   |	|		name	|
	|	salary |	|_______________|
	|	dept   |	
	|__________|	

	public class Department {
		private long id;
		private String name;
		Department() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

	public class Employee {
		private long id;
		private String name;
		private long salary;
		private Department dept;
		Employee() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

Providing annotation based Hibernate mapping.
	Consider

	@Entity
	@Table(name = "employee")
	public class Employee {

		@Id
		@Column(name = "id")
		@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
		private long id;

		@Column(name="name")
		private String name;

		@Column(name = "salary")
		private long salary;

		Employee() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

	@Entity: This annotation declares the class as an entity bean.
	@Table: We can set this annotation at the class level only. You can provide the name attribute, which is considered as a database table name. You can also just write @Table without any attribute; in this case, the class name is considered as a table name by hibernate.
	@Id: This annotation declares the property to be an identifier property, and this is used as a primary key for the table.
	@Column: This annotation is used to define the column for the table. Here, we used name="id", meaning that hibernate considers the column name to be "id". You can also write @Column without any attributes; in this case, the property name is considered to be a column name for the table.
	@GeneratedValue: Using this annotation, we can provide information to hibernate on how to generate a value for the primary key column. Here, we will use strategy = GenerationType.AUTO, which means that hibernate uses the autoincrement value for the id column. If not provided, hibernate uses the most appropriate generation strategy.
	
	Let us try to reference a different object in the Employee class

	@Entity
	@Table(name = "employee")
	public class Employee {

		@Id
		@Column(name = "id")
		@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
		private long id;

		@Column(name="name")
		private String name;

		@Column(name = "salary")
		private long salary;

		@JoinColumn(name = "department")
		@ManyToOne
		private Department dept;

		Employee() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

	@Entity
	@Table(name = "department")
	public class Department {

		@Id
		@Column(name = "id")
		@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
		private long id;

		@Column
		private String name;
		Department() {}
		// getters and setters
	}

	@JoinColumn: This annotation notifies hibernate that this is a reference column.
	@ManyToOne: This annotation defines the relation between the referenced tables. Here, we have used many-to-one, meaning that one department can be mapped with multiple employees.

SessionFactory
	SessionFactory is a factory of sessions. It has the following features.
		It's an interface implemented using the singleton pattern.
		It's created using the configuration provided by the configuration file.
		It's thread-safe, so it's created once during the application's lifetime, and multiple users or threads can access it at the same time without any concurrency issue.
		As a SessionFactory object is immutable, changes made to the configuration will not affect the existing factory object.
		It's a factory class, and its main duty is to create, manage, and retrieve a session on request. A Session is used to get a physical connectivity with the database.

Creating a SessionFactory object
	Consider the code

	Configuration configuration = new Configuration(); // creates a blank configuration.
	configuration = configuration.configure(); // fetch properties defined in hibernate.properties file	
	StandardServiceRegistryBuilder builder = new StandardServiceRegistryBuilder(); // create a builder object
	builder = builder.applySettings(configuration.getProperties()); // provide settings to builder object
	SessionFactory sessionFactory = configuration.buildSessionFactory(builder.build()); // create sessionFactory object using builder

	We can create two different builder objects if we want to connect to 2 different databases and we can create two different SessionFactory objects.

Opening a session
	A Session is also known as an interface that is used to get a physical connectivity with a database.
	It is instantiated every time we need to interact with the database for the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
	Persistent objects always travel from the application to the database and vice versa only through the Session.
	To open a session, we can call the openSession() method on the sessionFactory object. This method returns a Session object and it opens the database connection when it is created and holds it until the session is closed.
	A Session created using the openSession() method is not associated with any thread, so it's our responsibility to flush or close it once we are done with the database operation.
	A Session is a bridge between the Java application and hibernate. The Session interface wraps the JDBC connection.
	A Session always tries to be in sync with the persistent store where all transactions are made.
	A Session is always a part of first-level cache; it caches all the objects that are transmitted through that particular session. All cached objects will be destroyed once this session is closed.

Projections

Basic annotations
	Annotation is used to provide a metadata of code. 
	It is a part of the code file itself. 
	It is used to give some extra information about the code and can be used with variables, method packages, the interface, or the class itself.

@Entity and @Table
	Hibernate considers the class as a persistent class if it is annotated with the @Entity annotation.
	We annotate a class, Employee, with the @Entity annotation. As a result, hibernate considers the current class eligible to be persisted.

	@Entity
	public class Employee {
	// Fields and getter/setter
	}

	If we want a user-defined table name rather than a default name, we can use the @Table annotation.

	@Entity
	@Table(name="tbl_employee")
	public class Employee {
	// Fields and getter/setter
	}

	The attribute uniqueConstraints can also be used with @Table annotation. It is used when we need the UNIQUE key constraint with multiple fields.

	@Entity
	@Table(name = "tbl_employee", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "id" , "empCode"}))
	public class Employee {
		@Id
		private long id;
		@Column
		private String empCode;
	}

	When a SessionFactory is created for the first time and property hbm2ddl.auto is set to create, hibernate will create a table and the unique key constraints.
	When the table is created using the preceding code, hibernate will create the UNIQUE key using two fields: id and empCode.
	The uniqueConstraints is useful when we need a UNIQUE constraint for multiple fields. For only one column, you can use the @Column(unique=true) annotation directly on the field.

@Column 
	@Column annotation is used to tell hibernate that a property in the entity class is going to behave as a column in the database.

	@Entity
	public class Employee {
		@Column
		private String empCode;
	}

	If we need a custom column name, we can use the name attribute
	The length attribute is used to provide the column with a maximum size. If length is not provided, the default size of the data type is used, and it is database-specific.
	The nullable attribute accepts a Boolean value. If nullable is true, it means that the column contains a NULL value. It does not accept NULL if the value of nullable is set to false, but the default value of nullable is true.
	The unique attribute also accepts a Boolean value. If unique is set to true, hibernate will create a column with a UNIQUE index. However, the default value is false.

@Id and @IdClass
	It's necessary to declare an Identity column in each class while developing with hibernate.
	Sometimes, when we need to declare a primary key as a combination of multiple columns, we call this the composite primary key, as the primary key is composed of multiple columns.
	To declare a column as a primary key column, we use the @Id annotation. Hibernate creates a primary key column and also adds the primary key index to it.
	To create a composite key using multiple columns, annotate all the columns which will be part of composite key with @Id annotation and annotate the entity class with @IdClass annotation

	@Entity
	@IdClass(Employee.class)
	public class Employee implements Serializable {
		@Id
		private String firstName;
		@Id
		private String phone;
	}

	Another thing that needs to be taken care of is that the entity class must implement Serializable if you plan to store the entity in any cache, session, or you wish to transfer the entity over wire.
