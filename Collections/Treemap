TreeMap
	TreeMap is a collection of K,V pairs where the collection is sorted in the specified order of keys.
	If default natural sorting order is used, then the sorting is ascending order of keys. Else, the sorting determined by the comparator.
	TreeMap is not synchronized internally. 
	The TreeMap class implements Map interfaces including NavigableMap, SortedMap and extends AbstractMap.
	TreeMap in Java does not allow null keys (like Map) and thus a NullPointerException is thrown. However, multiple null values can be associated with different keys.
	All Map.Entry pairs returned by methods in this class and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were produced. They do not support the Entry.setValue() method.
	
Constructors in the TreeMap 
	TreeMap tm = new TreeMap() : Constructs an empty tree map that will be sorted by using the natural order of its keys.
	TreeMap tm = new TreeMap(Comparator c); Constructs an empty tree-based map that will be sorted by using the Comparator c
	TreeMap tm = new TreeMap(Map m); Initializes a tree map with the entries from m, which will be sorted by using the natural order of the keys
	TreeMap tm = new TreeMap(SortedMap sm); Initializes a tree map with the entries from sm, which will be sorted in the same order as sm.
	
Differences between HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap
	HashMap
		HashMap offers O(1) lookup and insertion.
		HashMap is implemented by an array of linked lists.
		A HashMap contains values based on the key.
		HashMap contains only unique keys.
		HashMap may have one null key and multiple null values.
		HashMap maintains no order.
		
	LinkedHashMap
		LinkedHashMap offers 0(1) lookup and insertion.
		Keys are ordered by their insertion order.
		It is implemented by doubly-linked buckets.
		It is same as HashMap instead maintains insertion order.
	
	TreeMap
		TreeMap offers O(log N) lookup and insertion.
		Keys are ordered, so if you need to iterate through the keys in sorted order, you can.
		TreeMap is implemented by a Red-Black Tree.
		It is same as HashMap instead maintains ascending order(Sorted using the natural order of its key).
