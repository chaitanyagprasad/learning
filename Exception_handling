Introduction
	Exception is a unexpected interruption to the normal flow of execution.
	Purpose of exception handling is graceful termination of the program. We should not lose anything.
	Defining alternative way to continue rest of program is the concept of exception handling
	
Runtime stack mechanism
	For every thread JVM will create a runtime stack. Every method call performed by the trhead will be stored in the runtime stack.
	Each entry in the stack is called as activation record.
	After each method succesfully completes, the entry from the runtime stack will be removed. After all methods are completed, the JVM deletes the stack.
	
Default exception handling in Java
	Whenever an exception occurs in a thread, the method in which the exception occurs is responsible to create exception object by including the name, description, method location and hands over the object to JVM.
	JVM then terminates the method that caused the exception abnormally. Then the control will go to the method that invoked the next activation record. This continues till the JVM terminates the main().
	When JVM terminates main(), the default exception handler prints the exception to the console.
	If at least one method is terminated abnormally, then program is terminated abnormally.
	
Exception Hierarchy
	Throwable class acts as the root class for all exception.
	Throwable class contains 2 child classes. 
		Exception class
			Exceptions are caused by program.
			Exceptions are recoverable.
		Error class
			Errors are not caused by program. They are caused by lack of system resources.
			Errors are not recoverable and program will be terminated abnormally
	
	Exception has many child classes.
	
Checked and unchecked exceptions.
	Every exception occurs only at runtime whether it is checked or unchecked.
	The exception checked by compiler for smooth execution of the program at runtime is called checked exception.
	If checked exception are not caught, we get compile time error.
	Checked exceptions must be compulsarily handled using either try/catch block or by throws keyword.
	The exception not checked by the compiler is called unchecked exceptions.
	All errors and its child classes, Runtime exception and its child classes are unchecked. Except these, remaining are checked.
	
Fully checked vs partially checked exceptions.
	A checked exception is said to be fully checked if all its children is also checked Ex. IOException. It is partially checked exception if otherwise. 
	The only possible partially checked exception in Java are Exception and Throwable.
	
Customized exception handling using try/catch
	Risky code is always is wrapped inside the try block. Corresponding handling code is to be written in catch block. 
	Statements which run into exception and it is not part of try block, then the program will abnormally terminate.
	All statements after catch block are also executed.
	Within try block, anywhere an exception raises, then rest of try block wont be executed. Hence within try block, only take risky code and length of try block must be as less as possible.
	Exception may be inside catch and finally blocks too.
	
Methods to print exception information
	Throwable class defines the following methods to print exception
	printStackTrace() => name of exception, description and location.
	toString() => name of exception, description
	getMessage() => description only.
	Internally, default exception handler will use printStackTrace().
	
Try with multiple catch block.
	Way of handling exception varies from exception to exception. Hence, we can have multiple catch block for different type of exception occuring in the risky code.
	While using multiple catch blocks, the order of catch block matters. Child exception must be handled first, then parent. Otherwise we get compile time error.
	
final keyword	
	final keyword is a modifier applicable for classes, methods and variables.
	If a class is declared as final, we cant create subclasses from it ie we cant extend that class ie inheritence is not possible.
	If a method is declared as final, we cant override that method in the child class.
	If a variable is declared as final, we cant reassign any other value to it.
	
finally keyword.
	finally is a block, always associated with the try/catch block to perform clean up code.
	finally block will be executed always whether exception occurs or not and whether the exception is handled or not.
	Ex.
	try {
		risky code
	} catch( Exception e) {
		handling code
	} finally {
		clean up code
	}
	finally block will perform clean up activities opened as part of its corresponding try block.
	
finalize keyword:
	finalize is a method that is executed by an object just before the object is collected for garbage collection.
	Once the finalize method is completed, GC can destroy the object.
	finalize method is invoked by GC.
	finalize method is used to perform cleanup activities opened by corresponding object.
	
Various possible combinations of try/catch finally.
	1. try/catch(Exception e) => possible
	2. try/catch(Exception e)/catch(Exception f) => possible
	3. try/catch(Exception e)/catch(Exception e) => not possible ie compile time error
	4. try/catch(Exception e)/finally => possible
	5. try/finally => possible. program terminates abnormally but performs clean up
	6. try/catch(Exception e)/try/catch(Exception e) => possible
	7. try/catch(Exception e)/try/finlly => possible
	8. try => not possible ie compile time error.
	9. catch(Exception e) => not possible ie compile time error
	10. finally => not possible
	11. try/finally/catch(Exception e) => not possible. order important ie compile time error.
	12. for try catch and finally blocks, curly braces are mandatory.
	
	In try/catch/finally order is important.
	Whenever we write try block, we must write catch or finally block else we get compile time error.
	Whenever we write catch block, compulsary try block must be required ie catch without try is invalid
	Whenever we write finally block, compulsary try block must be required ie finally without try is invalid
	Inside try, catch and finally we can nest try catch and finally blocks.
	For try catch and finally blocks, curly braces are mandatory.
	
throw keyword
	Sometimes, we can create exception object explicitly and handover to the JVM manually.
	The throw keyword is used to hand over the created exception object manually to the JVM.
	By default, the method where the exception occurs is responsible to create the exception object and handover to JVM. In case of manual handover, the programmer is responsible to create exception object.
	The throw keyword is best used for creating user defined exception.
	
Case 1: 
	public class Test{
		static ArithmeticException e = new ArithmeticException();
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			throw e; // ArithmeticException as e has been pointed to ArithmeticException object
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		static ArithmeticException e;
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			throw e; // NullPointerException as static variable e is null
		}
	}
	
Case 2:
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			System.out.println(10/0); // runtime exception
			System.out.println("Hello");
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			throw new ArithmeticException();
			System.out.println("Hello"); // compilt time error => unreachable error
		}
	}
	After throw statement, we cant have any statement directly
	
Case 3:
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			throw new Test(); // compile time error => incompatible type exception
		}
	}
	
	With the throw keywords, we can only use objects which are children of Throwable class and not any Java object.
	
throws keyword
	If in our code, there is a possibility of rising checked exception, then compiler wont compile the code until the checked exception is handled.
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt"); // compile time error => checked exception must be handled
			pw.println("Hello");
		}
	}
	There are 2 ways to handle this problem. 
		a) try/catch block 
		public class Test{
			public static void main(String[] args) {
				try {
					PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
					pw.println("Hello");
				}catch (Exception e) {
					System.out.println(e);
				}
			}
		}
		
		b) throws keyword: It is used to delegate the responsibility of exception handling to the caller of the method. The caller may be JVM or another method in the method stack 
		public class Test{
			public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
				PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
				pw.println("Hello");
			}
		}
	The throws keyword is useful only for checked exception. For unchecked exception is meaningless.
	The throws keyword is needed to convince the compiler. Usage of throws doesnt prevent abnormal termination of program.
	Example
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			doStuff();
		}
		public static void doStuff() {
			doMoreStuff();
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff() {
			Thread.sleep(10000); //compile time error => Unhandled exception type InterruptedException
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			doStuff();
		}
		public static void doStuff() {
			doMoreStuff(); //compile time error => Unhandled exception type InterruptedException
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			Thread.sleep(10000);
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			doStuff(); //compile time error => Unhandled exception type InterruptedException
		}
		public static void doStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			doMoreStuff();
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			Thread.sleep(10000);
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
			doStuff();
		}
		public static void doStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			doMoreStuff();
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			Thread.sleep(10000);
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
			doStuff();
		}
		public static void doStuff()  {
			doMoreStuff();
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff()  {
			Thread.sleep(10000); //compile time error => Unhandled exception type InterruptedException as there is no delegation to caller method
		}
	}
	
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
			doStuff();
		}
		public static void doStuff()  {
			doMoreStuff(); //compile time error => Unhandled exception type InterruptedException as there is no delegation to caller method
		}
		public static void doMoreStuff() throws InterruptedException {
			Thread.sleep(10000);
		}
	}
	
	The throws can be used on method level and constructor level. The throws keyword is not valid for classes.
	
	The throws keyword is only applicable for Throwable and its children and not for other java objects.
	Example
	public class Test{
		public static void main(String[] args) throws Test {    // compile time error =>  an exception type must be a subclass of Throwable    
		}    
	}
	Correct as follows
	public class Test extends RuntimeException{
		public static void main(String[] args) throws Test {        
		}    
	}
	
	Consider 
	public class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {    
			throw new Exception();  // compile time error => Unhandled exception type Exception 
		}    
	}
	Exception class is checked and compiler complains because compiler will only consider checked exception.
	public class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {    
			throw new Error(); // runtime exception   
		}    
	}
	
	If there is no chance of rising a particular exception and we write catch block for that particular exception, we get compile time error.
	This rule is applicable for fully-checked exception
	public class Test {
		public static void main(String[] args) {    
			try {
				System.out.println("hello");
			}catch(IOException e) { // compile time error => This exception is never thrown from the try statement body

			}
		}    
	}
	
Exception handling keywords summary
	1. try => to maintain risky code inside the block
	2. catch => to maintain exception handling code
	3. finally => to maintain clean up code
	4. throw => to manually handover created exception object to JVM
	5. throws => to delegate exception handling responsibility to the caller method.

User defined exceptions	
	To meet programming requirements, we can write our own exception. This is called user defined exception.
	Every exception is a java class and it must be a child class of Throwable class.
	Example
	public class Test {
		static int balance = 15000;
		public static void main(String[] args) {    
		  int drawableAmount = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
		  if ( drawableAmount > balance )  {
			throw new InsufficientFundsException("Insufficient funds");
		  }
		}    
	}
	class InsufficientFundsException extends RuntimeException {
		InsufficientFundsException(String s) {
			super(s); // to make description available to printStackTrace of Throwable class
		}
	}
	
	The throw keyword is best suitable for user defined exceptions but not for pre defined exceptions.
	It is highly recommended to extend custom exception with RuntimeException so that compiler doesnt object.
